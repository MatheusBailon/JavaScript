Desafio. Minigame em JavaScript

Desafios (in inglish):

1. A player looses his ENTIRE score when he rolls two 6 in a row. After that, it's the next player's turn. (Hint: Always save the previous dice roll in a separate variable)
2. Add an input field to the HTML where players can set the winning score, so that can change the predefined score of 100. (Hint: you can read the value whith .value property in JavaScript. This is a good oportunity to use google to figure this out :).
3. Add another dice to the game, so that there ara two dice now. The player looses his current score when one of them is a 1. (Hint: you need CSS to position the second dice, so take a look at the CSS cod for the first one.)
